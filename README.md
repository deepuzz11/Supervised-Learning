# Student Scores Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict student scores based on the number of study hours using linear regression. It explores the relationship between study hours and scores through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a predictive model to estimate scores.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "student_scores.csv", which contains two columns: "Hours" (number of study hours) and "Scores" (student scores).

## Requirements
To run the code, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip: 
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
